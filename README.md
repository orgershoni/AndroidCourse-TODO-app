A : We didn't define any UX flow to let users edit a description on an existing TODO item.
Which UX flow will you define?

Q: I think it would be intuitive to define the flow as a click on the text view itself.
I also thought about an option to create icon of three vertical dots (more... icon), and to open a
menu of two option - Edit, Delete. This might be easier to figure out on the first usage, but I 
think must users would find in more convenient to use only 1 click.
As the project is built right now, it might be challenging to implement this UX, since now I use a
checkbox with text in it, so all the area of the task description in a button that checks / unchecks
the box. Meaning I would have to implement separate Views for edit the text and checking the box.
